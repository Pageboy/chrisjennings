This series of works on paper come from 1982. I was inspired by the notion that the combination of 3 items invokes harmony. I was struck by the phrase from Chinese Literature:

> Dao begets One (nothingness; or reason of being), One begets Two (yin and yang), Two begets Three (Heaven, Earth and Man; or yin, yang and breath qi), Three begets all things. All things carry the females and embrace the male. And by breathing together, they live in harmony...

Many are created with oil crayon but some are with pastel and some with pencil.
