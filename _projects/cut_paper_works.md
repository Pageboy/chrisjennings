In 1981 I focused on creating images that combined the inverted triangle with landscape. I used paper with cut slots to insert a separate element. All of these images use cotton rag paper (Rives) and most are using crayon and pastel. They are all square, in 2 different sizes. The inserted element indicates a detail observed in the landscape (sea, sky, land etc).

The inverted triangle with it's single upright represents the a female form but with also a single gesture of a finger against the lips - meaning quietness and solitude.

There is one image where the triangle is not inverted but rather is seen as a pyramid in a landscape.
