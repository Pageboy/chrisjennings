Walls to hold us in, walls to keep us apart. But walls can also present interesting textures and support plants. Did you walk by a wall today and see some graffiti on it? Did you lean on a wall while waiting for your bus?

A wall keeps Pyramus and Thisbe apart, but they manage to whisper to each other through a crack:

> often, when they stood, **Thisbe** on one side, **Pyramus** on the other side, and in turn had inhaled the breath of each other's mouth,
> they would say, 'O envious wall, why do you block lovers?
> how great it would be if you let us be joined in whole body,
> Or, if this is too much, if you rather lay open for kisses to be [^1]

*Pyramus and Thisbe* is also `the play within a play` of Shakespeare's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.

> This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
> Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
> And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
> To whisper.

I wonder if the 1968 film 'Wonderwall' jogs anyone's memory. Maybe you owned George Harrison's album of the same name.

I like finding interesting textures in walls of all kind. See my photos here.
