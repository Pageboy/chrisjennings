These *Folding Pieces* are evolved from a perception of change and movement in the landscape. My early kinetic pieces, mirror works, and long study of megalithic sites in the landscape have led me to develop structures that reflect this change and movement. I am is concerned with the way in which horizons, mountains, and sea unfold and change, recede and converge with the passage of the onlooker - the eye travels across the landscape and there is no fixed viewpoint.

Folding Pieces combine the static elements and changing horizons of each natural landscape. Each work can be folded into different configurations. Each configuration is an altered perception of the same landscape. The folding of the work is neither play, performance nor participation, but a serious attempt to liberate different images held in one landscape.
