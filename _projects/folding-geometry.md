Works on paper and wood from 1983-5. The idea for these pieces came from the [Landscape series](https://www.chrisjennings.net/projects/folding_pieces/), but take a more geometric abstract approach.

The medium is oil pastel on paper and then bonded to hardwood pieces. They can folded several different ways. Some arrangements can be seen in the installation at Research Machines, Oxford 1984 and the Exhibition in [Galeri Lang, MÃ¥lmo, Sweden, 1984](https://www.chrisjennings.net/projects/galeri_lang_malmo/)
