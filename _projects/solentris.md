*Solentris* was a kinetic sculpture created for the Southampton General Hospital in 1986-7.

The sculpture consisted of three triangles made from aluminium mast section and welded together at the corners. Each triangle was connected through a steel cable via bearings. They were alternated so that the centre triangle was inverted. They were balanced so as to rotate randomly about the cable.

The opposite corners of the triangles were filled with sails in alternating coloured bands.

The cables were tensioned with 3 winches fixed to the wall with the top pulley at 18 metres above ground.

The whole construction was installed in a void within the building and the sculpture could be viewed from all floors including the reception area.

In 2000 it was decided to make better use of the void in the building and the sculpture was removed.
