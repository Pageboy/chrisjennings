My work is concerned with TIME as well as SPACE. I invite the spectator to rotate the moveable elements and then observe the changes in the geometry as the piece gradually returns to its static form. I try to give an awareness of cyclical time rather than linear or sequential time. I use component parts in the construction o these Sculptures as a way to imply potential change.

In *Turning Pieces* I invite the spectator to rotate the moveable elements and then to observe the changes in the geometry as the piece returns to its static form.
