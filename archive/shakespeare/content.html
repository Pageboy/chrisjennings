				<h1>The Content</h1>
				<H3>The Plays</H3>
				<P>A survey of the needs of the market in the UK and the US was conducted,
    so that we could decide on the most appropriate plays to publish and in
    which order. The decision to publish Romeo &amp; Juliet was basically because
    it seems to be the most popular both in the US and the UK and possibly
    the best known play worldwide. </P>
    <P>The decision was also influenced by the fact that the assets available
    included good quality performances both in audio and video. </P>
    <H3>The Structure</H3>
    <P>The idea that the PERFORMANCE of the PLAY should be at the centre of
    these CD-ROMs came out of discussions by the editorial team. The prototype
    of Romeo &amp; Juliet included one scene from the play and some supplementary
    material. We invited several educationalists to a meeting and discussed
    this prototype. The decision to create a special education package with
    some photocopyable material came out of that meeting. </P>
