						<td width="429" height="96">The project to build a series of CD-ROMs was started in 1994. Three parties were joined by a common aim - to use CD-ROM to combine the text, the audio and the video of a Shakespeare play on one CD-ROM. Three plays were chosen: &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;. A further 3 plays where chosen for the second part of the project. These were: 'Julius Caesar', 'Hamlet' and 'The Tempest'.</td>

							<p><b>HarperCollins<i>Publishers</i></b></p>
							<p>The education division of Harper CollinsPublishers was the main contributor from this organisation, although at the time HarperCollins<i>Interactive</i> (another division) became involved. HarperCollins brought two major assets to this project: the text of the plays (Alexander Edition) and an audio performance.</p>
							<p><b>BBC Education</b> </p>
							<p>The BBC has an extensive archive of material relating to Shakespeare, and early on in the project a search of that archive was conducted for material relating to Romeo &amp; Juliet. Much use was made of the audio archives and several interviews and discussions are used on the CD-ROMs. The BBC had published productions of the plays on video and because these were the most up to date and included the complete text these were used. The BBC archives also included some documentary video material, much of which has found its way onto the discs.</p>
