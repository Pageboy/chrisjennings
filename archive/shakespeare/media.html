    <LI><B>The Play<BR>
    </B>The Alexander Editions of the Shakespeare plays are published by HarperCollins
    and this text was provided in electronic form. The play itself included
    tags used by the printers and so some processing was necassary to remove
    these unwanted tags. It was decided to use the text in a 'non-scrolling'
    form and so once the design had been fixed, the pages were marked up and
    so delivered to the screen in manageable chunks. </LI>

    <LI><B>The Hypertext</B><BR>
    In the book editions footnotes and commentary are printed on the left hand
    page. This text is also provided electronically and is then 'attached'
    as hypertext to the words within the play. Where the footnotes refer to
    paragraphs or sections, an icon is built into the text for interaction.

    A facility to search for a word in the play is included, and this builds

    The words of the play appear one screen at a time in synchrony with the

    <LI><B>Supplementary Text</B><BR>
    The majority of the other text on the CD-ROMs was written by the editors
    at HarperCollins (Rebecca Lloyd, Domenica de Rosa and Helen Clark). Some
    text was also specially commissioned for the section on 'Critical Opinions'.
    The supplementary text also included audio links to the play, so for example.
    if the text refers to a character speaking certain lines, then this can
    be heard when the words (in blue) are clicked on. </LI>

    <H2>The Audio </H2>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI><B>The Play</B><BR>
    HarperCollins was able to provide DAT tapes of the performance used in
    the HarperCollinsAudio productions and these were digitised and divided
    into discrete files for each of the scenes. </LI>
    <LI><B>Why didn't we use the audio from the video?</B><BR>
    We thought about this but we found that the perfotmance includes many silences
    and moments when swords are clashing or feet are shuffling. </LI>
    <LI><B>Syncronisation with the text</B><BR>
    Some cutting was necessary where the music began the scene because this
    interfered with the synchonisation with the text. Generally, the actors
    speak the same text as appears on the screen, although there are places
    where lines are missed or in one case where the actor repeats about three
    lines. This was edited out! </LI>
    <LI><B>Extracts from the play</B><BR>
    The audio of the play is continually referred to in the supplementary text.
    If a reference to a character speaking certain lines is made, then those
    lines will be heard when the user clicks over the blue words. </LI>
    <LI><B>Audio Archives</B><BR>
    There are many clips of audio taken from the BBC Radio archives. These
    were provided on audio casettes. Locating the appropriate extract was done
    by Domenica de Rosa at HarperCollins using a domestic cassette player.
    I don't think there was any alternative method but using the counter on
    a cassette recorder is NOT the most accurate system! </LI>

    <LI><B>Database of Images </B><BR>
    Picture research was done on the basis of 'let's see what we can find about
    Shakespeare and Romeo &amp; Juliet'. Visits were made to the Shakespeare
    Birthplace Trust and Birmingham Shakespeare Centre. Picture Libraries,
    such as The Mary Evans Picture Library and Hulton Deutsch were consulted
    and after several enjoyable trawls through masses of stuff by the editorial
    team, the decisions were made. <BR>

    <LI><B>Backgrounds</B><BR>
    Some pictures were hunted down for the specific needs of the backgrounds
    to the play and the supplementary material. Examples would be the old engravings
    of Verona and Mantua for the backgrounds to the play, and the image of
    the Globe Theatre for the background to the acts and scenes of the play.
    </LI>
    <LI><B>Captions</B><BR>
    Each of the images is linked to a caption database which contains a short
    and a long (up to 255 characters) caption. The short caption is displayed
    in the window title bar for the picture, the long caption is displayed
    when the user clicks over the enlarged picture. Each of the long captions
    also includes a credit to the owner of that picture. <A NAME="anchor142543"></A></LI>
    <LI><B>Character Images</B><BR>
    Within the CD-ROM performance of the play, the characters appear as stills
    on the right hand side of the stage. These stills are taken (mostly) from
    the video of the play. These character images also appear on the characters
    selection screen and many of the key players are also included on the main
    menu screen.</LI>

    We hope that all the copyrights of all the images have been cleared.The
    publishers have certainly tried to clear ALL rights. If anyone knows of
    any image not cleared for any reason then please contact me. Some picture
    libraries and owners of images are nervous of electronic publishing and
    are beginning to ask for assurances that images will not be provided in
    high resolution . Some are even asking that the images be encrypted. The
    images on these CD-ROMs are only available in a resolution of 72 dpi. Only
    some of the images are encrypted. Personally, I don't believe anyone is
    likely to copy the images and then reproduce them again, if they do, they
    are infringing the publishers' copyrights. </LI>

    <H2>Video</H2>
    <P><BR>
    All video material was provided by the BBC. Mostly we viewed VHS copies
    of broadcasted tapes although I did make a trip to BBC Centre to view a
    black and white celluloid of a 60's performance. The tapes were provided
    time coded and we were then able to specify which sections should be digitized.
    </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI><B>The digitization</B><BR>
      The video was digitized using Indeo Video for Windows. </LI>
    <LI><B>Why didn't we include the whole video performance on the CD-ROM ? </B><BR>
      the CD-ROM does not have enough data space (650 MB) to accomodate a 3 hour 
      video, even using the small window. <BR>
      Clearing and paying for the rights on such material is expensive <BR>
      Linking the video to the text is not only technically very difficult, it 
      is difficult for the users to perceive both at the same time. </LI>
    <LI><B>Video of the Plays</B><BR>
      The extracts from the videos of the plays were digitized at a frame rate 
      of 15 fps using a 240x180 window. The window for the video appears in the 
      place of the characters on the <A HREF="images/mac34.gif">right hand side 
      of the screen</A>. </LI>
    <LI><B>Synchronisation with the text</B><BR>
      We found it impossible to synchronise the video with the text. As the software 
      changes to the next page of text so there was a momentary but noticeable 
      blip in the video. We abandoned the idea and so the selection of the video 
      clip simply 'rewinds' the text to the starting point of that video extract. 
    </LI>
    <LI><B>Supplementary Video </B><BR>
      The BBC provided us with several programs that made mention of Shakespeare 
      or one of the chosen plays. It was decided to construct the screens with 
      the first frame of the chosen clip. We decided to use the smaller window 
      size of 160x120. <A HREF="images/maclang.gif">See an example</A> of how 
      this was used. Much use was made of this video in the section on the <A HREF=
    "images/shakes.gif">Life of Shakespeare</A>. </LI>
