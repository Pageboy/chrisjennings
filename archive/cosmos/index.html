  '<A HREF="construct.html">The COSMOS</A>' is a kinetic painting created
  in 1965 and installed in the Helena Kennedy Student Centre, the building
  that once housed the publishers, Pergamon Press. This work belongs to the
  Malina family and is on loan to Oxford Brookes University. <BR>

  <A HREF="fjmalina.html#anchor641483">Frank J. Malina</A> was a rare combination
  of scientist and artist. In the 1940's, as a scientist he worked on high
  altitude rocket flight and co-founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
  California. As an artist in the 50's and 60's he developed several different
  types of kinetic painting and this piece is representative of his 'Lumidyne
  System', made from electric light, shining through moving elements.<BR>

  When &quot;The COSMOS&quot; was installed in 1966, Frank Malina wote: </B><BR>
  <BR>
  'We live at a time when, because of man's first steps in exploring extraterrestrial
  space, we are more conscious of the universe, both intellectually and visually,
  than at any time since Copernicus led the overthrow of the Earth-centered
  cosmos. The galaxies, nebulae, stars, palanets and moons that we can see....
  make up a universe that appears to us as a silent almost static panorama.
  That it is not static we know.....There are turbulent storms on the Sun,
  comets zooming through the void and other motions of matter in the far
  reaches of space....The mural might be called an expression of a &quot;peaceful&quot;
  Cosmos; not that, in reality, the universe is always so. Events of cataclysmic
  proportions are constantly occuring. Still, man - that fragile creature
  of Earth - dares to venture forth farther and farther away from his planetary
  cradle. The artist, in his turn, is challenged to find aesthetic significance
  in these experiences or to mock them in despair.'</P>
