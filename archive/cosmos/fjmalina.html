  <P>Frank Malina, founder of <A HREF="http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/Leonardo/leohome.html">Leonardo</A>,
  was an American scientist. After receiving his Ph.D from the California
  Institute of Technology in 1936, Malina directed the WAC Corporal program
  that put thefirst rocket beyond the Earth's atmosphere. He co-founded and
  was the second director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), co-founded
  the Aerojet General Corporation and was an activeparticipant in rocket-science
  development in the period leading up to and during World War II.</P>

  <P>Invited to join the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization
  (UNESCO) in1947 by <A HREF="http://www.panda.org/research/history/sixties.htm">Julian
  Huxley</A>, Malina moved to Paris as the director of the organization's
  science programs. The separation between science and the humanities was
  the subject of intense debateduring the post-war period, particularly after
  the publication of C.P. Snow's Two Cultures in 1959. The concept that there
  was and should be a natural relationship between science and art fascinated
  Malina, eventually influencing him to synthesize his scientific experience
  with hislong-standing artistic sensibilities. As an artist, Malina moved
  from traditional media to mesh,string and canvas constructions and finally
  to experiments with light, which led to his developmentof systems for kinetic
  painting.<BR>
  <BR>
  In his work as a scientist and engineer, Malina had access to an abundance
  of scholarly periodicalsthat enabled peers in any given field to stay abreast
  of each other's work and to monitor importantnews developments. There was
  no equivalent publication for artists, so he decided to start one. The
  concept was simple---a publication by serious artists with subject integrity
  secured by the samekind of peer review of articles that is common in scientific
  journals. Malina felt that the demystification of modern art could, in
  part, be accomplished by the free exchange of information regarding artistic
  disciplines.<BR>

  <B>The Leonardo Legacy</B><BR>
  Following Frank Malina's death in 1981, Leonardo was moved to California
  by his son <A HREF="http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~rmalina/">Roger F.Malina</A>,
  an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley. With the support
  of foundingboard members Frank Oppenheimer and Robert Maxwell, the International
  Society for the Arts,Sciences and Technology (Leonardo/ISAST) was formed
  in 1982. Leonardo/ISAST was created toaddress the rapidly expanding needs
  of the art, science and technology community---byparticipation in conferences,
  symposia, festivals and awards programs, in addition to providingsupport
  for the journal Leonardo. In 1991, the publication grew from a quarterly
  to a bimonthlyjournal and spawned a companion volume, the Leonardo Music
  Journal, dedicated to music and thesound arts and published with an audio
  compact disc (CD).</P>
