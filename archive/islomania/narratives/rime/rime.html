THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER IN SEVEN PARTS<BR>



BY SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE<BR>







PART THE FIRST.<BR>



It is an ancient Mariner,<BR>

And he stoppeth one of three.<BR>

"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<BR>

Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?<BR>



"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,<BR>

And I am next of kin;<BR>

The guests are met, the feast is set:<BR>

May'st hear the merry din."<BR>



He holds him with his skinny hand,<BR>

"There was a ship," quoth he.<BR>

"Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"<BR>

Eftsoons his hand dropt he.<BR>



He holds him with his glittering eye--<BR>

The Wedding-Guest stood still,<BR>

And listens like a three years child:<BR>

The Mariner hath his will.<BR>



The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:<BR>

He cannot chuse but hear;<BR>

And thus spake on that ancient man,<BR>

The bright-eyed Mariner.<BR>



The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<BR>

Merrily did we drop<BR>

Below the kirk, below the hill,<BR>

Below the light-house top.<BR>



The Sun came up upon the left,<BR>

Out of the sea came he!<BR>

And he shone bright, and on the right<BR>

Went down into the sea.<BR>



Higher and higher every day,<BR>

Till over the mast at noon--<BR>

The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<BR>

For he heard the loud bassoon.<BR>



The bride hath paced into the hall,<BR>

Red as a rose is she;<BR>

Nodding their heads before her goes<BR>

The merry minstrelsy.<BR>



The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<BR>

Yet he cannot chuse but hear;<BR>

And thus spake on that ancient man,<BR>

The bright-eyed Mariner.<BR>



And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he<BR>

Was tyrannous and strong:<BR>

He struck with his o'ertaking wings,<BR>

And chased south along.<BR>



With sloping masts and dipping prow,<BR>

As who pursued with yell and blow<BR>

Still treads the shadow of his foe<BR>

And forward bends his head,<BR>

The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,<BR>

And southward aye we fled.<BR>



And now there came both mist and snow,<BR>

And it grew wondrous cold:<BR>

And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<BR>

As green as emerald.<BR>



And through the drifts the snowy clifts<BR>

Did send a dismal sheen:<BR>

Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--<BR>

The ice was all between.<BR>



The ice was here, the ice was there,<BR>

The ice was all around:<BR>

It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<BR>

Like noises in a swound!<BR>



At length did cross an Albatross:<BR>

Thorough the fog it came;<BR>

As if it had been a Christian soul,<BR>

We hailed it in God's name.<BR>



It ate the food it ne'er had eat,<BR>

And round and round it flew.<BR>

The ice did split with a thunder-fit;<BR>

The helmsman steered us through!<BR>



And a good south wind sprung up behind;<BR>

The Albatross did follow,<BR>

And every day, for food or play,<BR>

Came to the mariners' hollo!<BR>



In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<BR>

It perched for vespers nine;<BR>

Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<BR>

Glimmered the white Moon-shine.<BR>



"God save thee, ancient Mariner!<BR>

From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--<BR>

Why look'st thou so?"--With my cross-bow<BR>

I shot the ALBATROSS.<BR>







PART THE SECOND.<BR>



The Sun now rose upon the right:<BR>

Out of the sea came he,<BR>

Still hid in mist, and on the left<BR>

Went down into the sea.<BR>



And the good south wind still blew behind<BR>

But no sweet bird did follow,<BR>

Nor any day for food or play<BR>

Came to the mariners' hollo!<BR>



And I had done an hellish thing,<BR>

And it would work 'em woe:<BR>

For all averred, I had killed the bird<BR>

That made the breeze to blow.<BR>

Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay<BR>

That made the breeze to blow!<BR>



Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,<BR>

The glorious Sun uprist:<BR>

Then all averred, I had killed the bird<BR>

That brought the fog and mist.<BR>

'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,<BR>

That bring the fog and mist.<BR>



The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,<BR>

The furrow followed free:<BR>

We were the first that ever burst<BR>

Into that silent sea.<BR>



Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,<BR>

'Twas sad as sad could be;<BR>

And we did speak only to break<BR>

The silence of the sea!<BR>



All in a hot and copper sky,<BR>

The bloody Sun, at noon,<BR>

Right up above the mast did stand,<BR>

No bigger than the Moon.<BR>



Day after day, day after day,<BR>

We stuck, nor breath nor motion;<BR>

As idle as a painted ship<BR>

Upon a painted ocean.<BR>



Water, water, every where,<BR>

And all the boards did shrink;<BR>

Water, water, every where,<BR>

Nor any drop to drink.<BR>



The very deep did rot: O Christ!<BR>

That ever this should be!<BR>

Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs<BR>

Upon the slimy sea.<BR>



About, about, in reel and rout<BR>

The death-fires danced at night;<BR>

The water, like a witch's oils,<BR>

Burnt green, and blue and white.<BR>



And some in dreams assured were<BR>

Of the spirit that plagued us so:<BR>

Nine fathom deep he had followed us<BR>

From the land of mist and snow.<BR>



And every tongue, through utter drought,<BR>

Was withered at the root;<BR>

We could not speak, no more than if<BR>

We had been choked with soot.<BR>



Ah! well a-day! what evil looks<BR>

Had I from old and young!<BR>

Instead of the cross, the Albatross<BR>

About my neck was hung.<BR>









PART THE THIRD.<BR>



There passed a weary time.  Each throat<BR>

Was parched, and glazed each eye.<BR>

A weary time! a weary time!<BR>

How glazed each weary eye,<BR>

When looking westward, I beheld<BR>

A something in the sky.<BR>



At first it seemed a little speck,<BR>

And then it seemed a mist:<BR>

It moved and moved, and took at last<BR>

A certain shape, I wist.<BR>



A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!<BR>

And still it neared and neared:<BR>

As if it dodged a water-sprite,<BR>

It plunged and tacked and veered.<BR>



With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<BR>

We could not laugh nor wail;<BR>

Through utter drought all dumb we stood!<BR>

I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,<BR>

And cried, A sail! a sail!<BR>



With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<BR>

Agape they heard me call:<BR>

Gramercy! they for joy did grin,<BR>

And all at once their breath drew in,<BR>

As they were drinking all.<BR>



See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!<BR>

Hither to work us weal;<BR>

Without a breeze, without a tide,<BR>

She steadies with upright keel!<BR>



The western wave was all a-flame<BR>

The day was well nigh done!<BR>

Almost upon the western wave<BR>

Rested the broad bright Sun;<BR>

When that strange shape drove suddenly<BR>

Betwixt us and the Sun.<BR>



And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,<BR>

(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)<BR>

As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,<BR>

With broad and burning face.<BR>



Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)<BR>

How fast she nears and nears!<BR>

Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,<BR>

Like restless gossameres!<BR>



Are those her ribs through which the Sun<BR>

Did peer, as through a grate?<BR>

And is that Woman all her crew?<BR>

Is that a DEATH? and are there two?<BR>

Is DEATH that woman's mate?<BR>



Her lips were red, her looks were free,<BR>

Her locks were yellow as gold:<BR>

Her skin was as white as leprosy,<BR>

The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,<BR>

Who thicks man's blood with cold.<BR>



The naked hulk alongside came,<BR>

And the twain were casting dice;<BR>

"The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!"<BR>

Quoth she, and whistles thrice.<BR>



The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:<BR>

At one stride comes the dark;<BR>

With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea.<BR>

Off shot the spectre-bark.<BR>



We listened and looked sideways up!<BR>

Fear at my heart, as at a cup,<BR>

My life-blood seemed to sip!<BR>



The stars were dim, and thick the night,<BR>

The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;<BR>

From the sails the dew did drip--<BR>

Till clombe above the eastern bar<BR>

The horned Moon, with one bright star<BR>

Within the nether tip.<BR>



One after one, by the star-dogged Moon<BR>

Too quick for groan or sigh,<BR>

Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,<BR>

And cursed me with his eye.<BR>



Four times fifty living men,<BR>

(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)<BR>

With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,<BR>

They dropped down one by one.<BR>



The souls did from their bodies fly,--<BR>

They fled to bliss or woe!<BR>

And every soul, it passed me by,<BR>

Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!<BR>









PART THE FOURTH.<BR>



"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!<BR>

I fear thy skinny hand!<BR>

And thou art long, and lank, and brown,<BR>

As is the ribbed sea-sand.<BR>



"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,<BR>

And thy skinny hand, so brown."--<BR>

Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!<BR>

This body dropt not down.<BR>



Alone, alone, all, all alone,<BR>

Alone on a wide wide sea!<BR>

And never a saint took pity on<BR>

My soul in agony.<BR>



The many men, so beautiful!<BR>

And they all dead did lie:<BR>

And a thousand thousand slimy things<BR>

Lived on; and so did I<BR>



I looked upon the rotting sea,<BR>

And drew my eyes away;<BR>

I looked upon the rotting deck,<BR>

And there the dead men lay.<BR>



I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:<BR>

But or ever a prayer had gusht,<BR>

A wicked whisper came, and made<BR>

my heart as dry as dust.<BR>



I closed my lids, and kept them close,<BR>

And the balls like pulses beat;<BR>

For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky<BR>

Lay like a load on my weary eye,<BR>

And the dead were at my feet.<BR>



The cold sweat melted from their limbs,<BR>

Nor rot nor reek did they:<BR>

The look with which they looked on me<BR>

Had never passed away.<BR>



An orphan's curse would drag to Hell<BR>

A spirit from on high;<BR>

But oh! more horrible than that<BR>

Is a curse in a dead man's eye!<BR>

Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,<BR>

And yet I could not die.<BR>



The moving Moon went up the sky,<BR>

And no where did abide:<BR>

Softly she was going up,<BR>

And a star or two beside.<BR>



Her beams bemocked the sultry main,<BR>

Like April hoar-frost spread;<BR>

But where the ship's huge shadow lay,<BR>

The charmed water burnt alway<BR>

A still and awful red.<BR>



Beyond the shadow of the ship,<BR>

I watched the water-snakes:<BR>

They moved in tracks of shining white,<BR>

And when they reared, the elfish light<BR>

Fell off in hoary flakes.<BR>



Within the shadow of the ship<BR>

I watched their rich attire:<BR>

Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,<BR>

They coiled and swam; and every track<BR>

Was a flash of golden fire.<BR>



O happy living things! no tongue<BR>

Their beauty might declare:<BR>

A spring of love gushed from my heart,<BR>

And I blessed them unaware:<BR>

Sure my kind saint took pity on me,<BR>

And I blessed them unaware.<BR>



The self same moment I could pray;<BR>

And from my neck so free<BR>

The Albatross fell off, and sank<BR>

Like lead into the sea.<BR>









PART THE FIFTH.<BR>



Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,<BR>

Beloved from pole to pole!<BR>

To Mary Queen the praise be given!<BR>

She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,<BR>

That slid into my soul.<BR>



The silly buckets on the deck,<BR>

That had so long remained,<BR>

I dreamt that they were filled with dew;<BR>

And when I awoke, it rained.<BR>



My lips were wet, my throat was cold,<BR>

My garments all were dank;<BR>

Sure I had drunken in my dreams,<BR>

And still my body drank.<BR>



I moved, and could not feel my limbs:<BR>

I was so light--almost<BR>

I thought that I had died in sleep,<BR>

And was a blessed ghost.<BR>



And soon I heard a roaring wind:<BR>

It did not come anear;<BR>

But with its sound it shook the sails,<BR>

That were so thin and sere.<BR>



The upper air burst into life!<BR>

And a hundred fire-flags sheen,<BR>

To and fro they were hurried about!<BR>

And to and fro, and in and out,<BR>

The wan stars danced between.<BR>



And the coming wind did roar more loud,<BR>

And the sails did sigh like sedge;<BR>

And the rain poured down from one black cloud;<BR>

The Moon was at its edge.<BR>



The thick black cloud was cleft, and still<BR>

The Moon was at its side:<BR>

Like waters shot from some high crag,<BR>

The lightning fell with never a jag,<BR>

A river steep and wide.<BR>



The loud wind never reached the ship,<BR>

Yet now the ship moved on!<BR>

Beneath the lightning and the Moon<BR>

The dead men gave a groan.<BR>



They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,<BR>

Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;<BR>

It had been strange, even in a dream,<BR>

To have seen those dead men rise.<BR>



The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;<BR>

Yet never a breeze up blew;<BR>

The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,<BR>

Were they were wont to do:<BR>

They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--<BR>

We were a ghastly crew.<BR>



The body of my brother's son,<BR>

Stood by me, knee to knee:<BR>

The body and I pulled at one rope,<BR>

But he said nought to me.<BR>



"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"<BR>

Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!<BR>

'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,<BR>

Which to their corses came again,<BR>

But a troop of spirits blest:<BR>



For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,<BR>

And clustered round the mast;<BR>

Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,<BR>

And from their bodies passed.<BR>



Around, around, flew each sweet sound,<BR>

Then darted to the Sun;<BR>

Slowly the sounds came back again,<BR>

Now mixed, now one by one.<BR>



Sometimes a-dropping from the sky<BR>

I heard the sky-lark sing;<BR>

Sometimes all little birds that are,<BR>

How they seemed to fill the sea and air<BR>

With their sweet jargoning!<BR>



And now 'twas like all instruments,<BR>

Now like a lonely flute;<BR>

And now it is an angel's song,<BR>

That makes the Heavens be mute.<BR>



It ceased; yet still the sails made on<BR>

A pleasant noise till noon,<BR>

A noise like of a hidden brook<BR>

In the leafy month of June,<BR>

That to the sleeping woods all night<BR>

Singeth a quiet tune.<BR>



Till noon we quietly sailed on,<BR>

Yet never a breeze did breathe:<BR>

Slowly and smoothly went the ship,<BR>

Moved onward from beneath.<BR>



Under the keel nine fathom deep,<BR>

From the land of mist and snow,<BR>

The spirit slid: and it was he<BR>

That made the ship to go.<BR>

The sails at noon left off their tune,<BR>

And the ship stood still also.<BR>



The Sun, right up above the mast,<BR>

Had fixed her to the ocean:<BR>

But in a minute she 'gan stir,<BR>

With a short uneasy motion--<BR>

Backwards and forwards half her length<BR>

With a short uneasy motion.<BR>



Then like a pawing horse let go,<BR>

She made a sudden bound:<BR>

It flung the blood into my head,<BR>

And I fell down in a swound.<BR>



How long in that same fit I lay,<BR>

I have not to declare;<BR>

But ere my living life returned,<BR>

I heard and in my soul discerned<BR>

Two VOICES in the air.<BR>



"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?<BR>

By him who died on cross,<BR>

With his cruel bow he laid full low,<BR>

The harmless Albatross.<BR>



"The spirit who bideth by himself<BR>

In the land of mist and snow,<BR>

He loved the bird that loved the man<BR>

Who shot him with his bow."<BR>



The other was a softer voice,<BR>

As soft as honey-dew:<BR>

Quoth he, "The man hath penance done,<BR>

And penance more will do."<BR>









PART THE SIXTH.<BR>





FIRST VOICE.<BR>



But tell me, tell me! speak again,<BR>

Thy soft response renewing--<BR>

What makes that ship drive on so fast?<BR>

What is the OCEAN doing?<BR>





SECOND VOICE.<BR>



Still as a slave before his lord,<BR>

The OCEAN hath no blast;<BR>

His great bright eye most silently<BR>

Up to the Moon is cast--<BR>



If he may know which way to go;<BR>

For she guides him smooth or grim<BR>

See, brother, see! how graciously<BR>

She looketh down on him.<BR>





FIRST VOICE.<BR>



But why drives on that ship so fast,<BR>

Without or wave or wind?<BR>





SECOND VOICE.<BR>



The air is cut away before,<BR>

And closes from behind.<BR>



Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high<BR>

Or we shall be belated:<BR>

For slow and slow that ship will go,<BR>

When the Mariner's trance is abated.<BR>



I woke, and we were sailing on<BR>

As in a gentle weather:<BR>

'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;<BR>

The dead men stood together.<BR>



All stood together on the deck,<BR>

For a charnel-dungeon fitter:<BR>

All fixed on me their stony eyes,<BR>

That in the Moon did glitter.<BR>



The pang, the curse, with which they died,<BR>

Had never passed away:<BR>

I could not draw my eyes from theirs,<BR>

Nor turn them up to pray.<BR>



And now this spell was snapt: once more<BR>

I viewed the ocean green.<BR>

And looked far forth, yet little saw<BR>

Of what had else been seen--<BR>



Like one that on a lonesome road<BR>

Doth walk in fear and dread,<BR>

And having once turned round walks on,<BR>

And turns no more his head;<BR>

Because he knows, a frightful fiend<BR>

Doth close behind him tread.<BR>



But soon there breathed a wind on me,<BR>

Nor sound nor motion made:<BR>

Its path was not upon the sea,<BR>

In ripple or in shade.<BR>



It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek<BR>

Like a meadow-gale of spring--<BR>

It mingled strangely with my fears,<BR>

Yet it felt like a welcoming.<BR>



Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,<BR>

Yet she sailed softly too:<BR>

Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--<BR>

On me alone it blew.<BR>



Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed<BR>

The light-house top I see?<BR>

Is this the hill? is this the kirk?<BR>

Is this mine own countree!<BR>



We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,<BR>

And I with sobs did pray--<BR>

O let me be awake, my God!<BR>

Or let me sleep alway.<BR>



The harbour-bay was clear as glass,<BR>

So smoothly it was strewn!<BR>

And on the bay the moonlight lay,<BR>

And the shadow of the moon.<BR>



The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,<BR>

That stands above the rock:<BR>

The moonlight steeped in silentness<BR>

The steady weathercock.<BR>



And the bay was white with silent light,<BR>

Till rising from the same,<BR>

Full many shapes, that shadows were,<BR>

In crimson colours came.<BR>



A little distance from the prow<BR>

Those crimson shadows were:<BR>

I turned my eyes upon the deck--<BR>

Oh, Christ! what saw I there!<BR>



Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,<BR>

And, by the holy rood!<BR>

A man all light, a seraph-man,<BR>

On every corse there stood.<BR>



This seraph band, each waved his hand:<BR>

It was a heavenly sight!<BR>

They stood as signals to the land,<BR>

Each one a lovely light:<BR>



This seraph-band, each waved his hand,<BR>

No voice did they impart--<BR>

No voice; but oh! the silence sank<BR>

Like music on my heart.<BR>



But soon I heard the dash of oars;<BR>

I heard the Pilot's cheer;<BR>

My head was turned perforce away,<BR>

And I saw a boat appear.<BR>



The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,<BR>

I heard them coming fast:<BR>

Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy<BR>

The dead men could not blast.<BR>



I saw a third--I heard his voice:<BR>

It is the Hermit good!<BR>

He singeth loud his godly hymns<BR>

That he makes in the wood.<BR>

He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away<BR>

The Albatross's blood.<BR>









PART THE SEVENTH.<BR>



This Hermit good lives in that wood<BR>

Which slopes down to the sea.<BR>

How loudly his sweet voice he rears!<BR>

He loves to talk with marineres<BR>

That come from a far countree.<BR>



He kneels at morn and noon and eve--<BR>

He hath a cushion plump:<BR>

It is the moss that wholly hides<BR>

The rotted old oak-stump.<BR>



The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,<BR>

"Why this is strange, I trow!<BR>

Where are those lights so many and fair,<BR>

That signal made but now?"<BR>



"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said--<BR>

"And they answered not our cheer!<BR>

The planks looked warped! and see those sails,<BR>

How thin they are and sere!<BR>

I never saw aught like to them,<BR>

Unless perchance it were<BR>



"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag<BR>

My forest-brook along;<BR>

When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,<BR>

And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,<BR>

That eats the she-wolf's young."<BR>



"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--<BR>

(The Pilot made reply)<BR>

I am a-feared"--"Push on, push on!"<BR>

Said the Hermit cheerily.<BR>



The boat came closer to the ship,<BR>

But I nor spake nor stirred;<BR>

The boat came close beneath the ship,<BR>

And straight a sound was heard.<BR>



Under the water it rumbled on,<BR>

Still louder and more dread:<BR>

It reached the ship, it split the bay;<BR>

The ship went down like lead.<BR>



Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,<BR>

Which sky and ocean smote,<BR>

Like one that hath been seven days drowned<BR>

My body lay afloat;<BR>

But swift as dreams, myself I found<BR>

Within the Pilot's boat.<BR>



Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,<BR>

The boat spun round and round;<BR>

And all was still, save that the hill<BR>

Was telling of the sound.<BR>



I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked<BR>

And fell down in a fit;<BR>

The holy Hermit raised his eyes,<BR>

And prayed where he did sit.<BR>



I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,<BR>

Who now doth crazy go,<BR>

Laughed loud and long, and all the while<BR>

His eyes went to and fro.<BR>

"Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see,<BR>

The Devil knows how to row."<BR>



And now, all in my own countree,<BR>

I stood on the firm land!<BR>

The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,<BR>

And scarcely he could stand.<BR>



"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"<BR>

The Hermit crossed his brow.<BR>

"Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say--<BR>

What manner of man art thou?"<BR>



Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched<BR>

With a woeful agony,<BR>

Which forced me to begin my tale;<BR>

And then it left me free.<BR>



Since then, at an uncertain hour,<BR>

That agony returns;<BR>

And till my ghastly tale is told,<BR>

This heart within me burns.<BR>



I pass, like night, from land to land;<BR>

I have strange power of speech;<BR>

That moment that his face I see,<BR>

I know the man that must hear me:<BR>

To him my tale I teach.<BR>



What loud uproar bursts from that door!<BR>

The wedding-guests are there:<BR>

But in the garden-bower the bride<BR>

And bride-maids singing are:<BR>

And hark the little vesper bell,<BR>

Which biddeth me to prayer!<BR>



O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been<BR>

Alone on a wide wide sea:<BR>

So lonely 'twas, that God himself<BR>

Scarce seemed there to be.<BR>



O sweeter than the marriage-feast,<BR>

'Tis sweeter far to me,<BR>

To walk together to the kirk<BR>

With a goodly company!--<BR>



To walk together to the kirk,<BR>

And all together pray,<BR>

While each to his great Father bends,<BR>

Old men, and babes, and loving friends,<BR>

And youths and maidens gay!<BR>



Farewell, farewell! but this I tell<BR>

To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!<BR>

He prayeth well, who loveth well<BR>

Both man and bird and beast.<BR>



He prayeth best, who loveth best<BR>

All things both great and small;<BR>

For the dear God who loveth us<BR>

He made and loveth all.<BR>



The Mariner, whose eye is bright,<BR>

Whose beard with age is hoar,<BR>

Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest<BR>

Turned from the bridegroom's door.<BR>



He went like one that hath been stunned,<BR>

And is of sense forlorn:<BR>

A sadder and a wiser man,<BR>

He rose the morrow morn.<BR>
