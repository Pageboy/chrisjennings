  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There was a man born 
  blind, who had several apprentices in his own condition; their employment was 
  to mix colors for painters, which their master taught them to distinguish by 
  feeling and smelling. It was indeed my misfortune to find them at that time 
  not very perfect in their lessons, and the professor himself happened to be 
  generally mistaken; this artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole 
  fraternity. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p>
