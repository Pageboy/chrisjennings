  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By means of this 
  loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move from one place to another. 
  For with respect to that part of the earth over which the monarch presides, 
  the stone is endued at one of its sides with an attractive power, and at the 
  other with a repulsive. Upon placing the magnet erect with its attracting end 
  towards the earth, the island descends; but when the repelling extremity points 
  downwards, the island mounts directly upwards. When the position of the stone 
  is oblique, the motion of the island is so too. For in this magnet the forces 
  always act in lines parallel to its direction. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By this oblique motion 
  the island is conveyed to different parts of the monarch's dominions. To explain 
  the manner of its progress, let AB represent a line drawn cross the dominions 
  of Balnibarbi, let the line cd represent the loadstone, of which let d be the 
  repelling end, and c the attracting end, the island being over C; let the stone 
  be placed in the position cd, with its repelling end downwards; then the island 
  will be driven upwards obliquely towards D. When it is arrived at D, let the 
  stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end points towards E, and 
  then the island will be carried obliquely towards E; where if the stone be again 
  turned upon its axle till it stands in the position EF, with its repelling point 
  downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards F, where by directing the 
  attracting end towards G, the island may be carried to G, and from G to H, by 
  turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity point directly downwards. 
  And thus by changing the situation of the stone as often as there is occasion, 
  the island is made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by 
  those alternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not considerable) 
  is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But it must be observed 
  that this island cannot move beyond the extent of the dominions below, nor can 
  it rise above the height of four miles. For which the astronomers (who have 
  written large systems concerning the stone) assign the following reason: that 
  the magnetic virtue does not extend beyond the distance of four Miles, and that 
  the mineral which acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the 
  sea about six leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole 
  globe, but terminated with the limits of the King's dominions; and it was easy 
  from the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to bring 
  under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of that magnet. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When the stone is put parallel 
  to the plane of the horizon, the island stands still; for in that case the extremities 
  of it being at equal distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one 
  in drawing downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion 
  can ensue. </font> </p>
