        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2"> Two years 
          before Columbus discovered the West Indies in 1492, Cristoforo Buondelmonti 
          published his 'Liber insularum archipelagi', The Book of the Islands 
          of the Archipelago. This early example of the genre of island literature 
          influenced Antonio Pigafetta when he wrote his account of Magellan's 
          Voyage around the World; he presented it as a work combining narrative 
          and cartography. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">Early 
          references to islands in Celtic myth and lore, and legends of islands 
          at the 'edge of the world' and the continuum of island literature and 
          narratives from then to now show that the concept of the island is embedded 
          into human consciousness. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">This project 
          is to research the genre of island narratives and create an 'archipelago' 
          of islands and cross-reference between them. Some of the islands in 
          this archipelago will be fictitious inventions of writers such as Shakespeare 
          and Stevenson. Some will be legendary and real, documented by explorers 
          and travellers like Dampier, and Slocum and mythical islands such as 
          the Atlantic Isle of Brazil near to Ireland. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">My intention 
          is to 'explore' the 'archipelago' and add new islands to the chart. 
          Some earlier 'visitors' to these islands will be researched and documented.</font>
