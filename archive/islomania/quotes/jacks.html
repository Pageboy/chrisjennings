      haunting passion was the island. I ransacked libraries for the literature 
      of Islands, the more desolate they were the better I was pleased. I pored 
      over great maps till Polynesia and Melanesia were more familiar than the 
      geography of the county in which I lived. I found that men who had written 
      of Utopia and other impossible things were as mad as I was about Islands, 
      and I loved them all and read their books over and over again. I knew the 
      Hebrides by heart, I was at home in the archipelagoes of the Pacific, I 
      could thread my way through among the smallest groups of the Indies, East 
      and West, and a navigator of the Cyclades might almost have used me for 
      a pilot. Columbus, Magellan, Drake, Dampier, Anson, Cook - these were the 
      names of my familiar spirits; and had I not sailed with Odysseus of many 
      devices over leagues and leagues of the the unharvested seas? It was always 
      the little islands I loved the best, and if they were not only small but 
      remote, like St.KIlda, Kerguelen, or <a href="../JuanFernandez/index.html" target="_blank">Juan 
      Fernandez</a>, so that the mariner shipwrecked on their shores might have 
      reasonable chance of being unrescued for years, I rejoiced like the man 
      who discovered a treasure hid in a field........</font></td>
