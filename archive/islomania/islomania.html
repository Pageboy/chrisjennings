            among the note-books of Gideon I once found a list of diseases as 
            yet unclassified by medical science, and among these there occurred 
            the word <b>Islomania</b>, which was described as a rare but by no 
            means unknown affliction of spirit. There are people, Gideon used 
            to say, by way of explanation, who find islands somehow irresistible. 
            The mere knowledge that they are on an island, a little world surrounded 
            by the sea, fells them with an in-describable intoxication. These 
            born 'islomanes', he used to add, are the direct descendants of the 
            Atlanteans, and it is towards the lost Atlantis that their subconscious 
            yearns throughout their island life.</font></td>
