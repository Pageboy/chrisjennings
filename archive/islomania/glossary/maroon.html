        put ashore on a desert isle, as a sailor, under pretense of having committed 
        some great crime." Thus our good Noah Webster gives us the dry bones, 
        the anatomy, upon which the imagination may construct a specimen to suit 
        itself. It is thence that the marooners took their name, for marooning 
        was one of their most effective instruments of punishment or revenge. 
        If a pirate broke one of the many rules which governed the particular 
        band to which he belonged, he was marooned; did a captain defend his ship 
        to such a degree as to be unpleasant to the pirates attacking it, he was 
        marooned; even the pirate captain himself, if he displeased his followers 
        by the severity of his rule, was in danger of having the same punishment 
        visited upon him which he had perhaps more than once visited upon another. 
        The process of marooning was as simple as terrible. A suitable place was 
        chosen (generally some desert isle as far removed as possible from the 
        pathway of commerce), and the condemned man was rowed from the ship to 
        the beach. Out he was bundled upon the sand spit; a gun, a half dozen 
        bullets, a few pinches of powder, and a bottle of water were chucked ashore 
        after him, and away rowed the boat's crew back to the ship, leaving the 
        poor wretch alone to rave away his life in madness, or to sit sunken in 
        his gloomy despair till death mercifully released him from torment. It 
        rarely if ever happened that anything was known of him after having been 
        marooned. A boat's crew from some vessel, sailing by chance that way, 
        might perhaps find a few chalky bones bleaching upon the white sand in 
        the garish glare of the sunlight, but that was all. And such were marooners.</font></p>
