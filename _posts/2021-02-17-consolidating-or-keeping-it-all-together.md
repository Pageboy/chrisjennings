I can't handle it anymore! Too many locations to post and so I have decided to *bite the bullet* - *grasp the nettle* and post all blog items here to chrisjennings.net. It makes sense 'cos that's who I am, and even though I have several *irons in my fire*, I need to keep it all together. Yes, all - photos, artwork, archive, design work, teaching work, whatever.

## The details

OK, so I'll keep [publisha.github.io](publisha.github.io) for the long form articles about eBook, InDesign and web work, but one off blog posts will be here. A dolly mixture of posts about HTML, My boat, travels, activities and so on.

### All these channels are too much for any human.

Isn't it even too much to deal with these channels - YouTube.Facebook.Flickr.Twitter - but let's keep those, but just have one web site (almost!).

### So here is the plan

pagetoscreen.net will be retired, so I won't link to it here. I have the domain publisha.org, so plan to move the github pages site to there.
