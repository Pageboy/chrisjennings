![Perspectief on the ramp](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51867676702_c27af2312b_3k_d.jpg "Perspectief on the ramp")

Perspectief needs an anti-foul refresh and so she needed to come out of the water. You can see from the photo here that we managed to pull her out with tractor and she now sits on the ramp secured and ready for the process which consists of:

* Power wash to remove the grime
* Sanding off to remove heavy limescale
* masking off at the water line
* 2 coats of anti-foul paint (I have Hempel blue)
* Extra coat at the water line
