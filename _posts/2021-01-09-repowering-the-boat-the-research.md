After a lot of research the decision has been made to replace the engine in *Perspectief*. Her engine is as old as the boat and maybe be even older. Here follows an explanation of why we need to get a new engine and also a narrative of the research undertaken. No doubt you will want to read on to find out the progress on the project, but this post is just about the research.

## What is the current engine (as of early 2021)?

When *Perspectief* was commissioned in 1987 at the z-yacht yard in the Netherlands, she was equiped with a Ford XLD 1.6 Diesel. This engine is sometimes referred to as the XLD-4016 but also as the Dagenham since it was produced at Ford's Dagenham plant (Dagenham is in Essex, UK). vThis Ford engine was fitted in a Ford Escort and also some vans.

### The Engine Marinised

It seems that the components for marinising this engine would have come from Lancing Marine in Sussex UK. I would imagine that the actual marinisation may have happened in Holland with parts shipped from the UK. 

Interestingy I have 2 books from **Haynes Publishers** - The *Ford 1.6 and 1.8 Diesel Engine* 1998, but also I recently discovered the *Diesel Boat Engine Manual*, Peter Bower 1989. This latter book has a section on marinising the Ford 1.6 from parts supplied by Lancing Marine.

### Why should the engine be replaced?

First of all, I should say that the engine has done very well and could probably go on for another 35 years, but here are some issues which make this engine less attractive for us cruisers:

* It is noisy. It's a fact and it may just be that the technology in diesel engine design from the 1980s is out of date
* It is too big. I mean that the physical size of the engine and gearbox fill the engine bay with no room to spare
* Hard to maintain. Due to the reason above, it is very difficult to do the simplest of tasks, like change the water pump impeller or tighten the alternator belt (virtually no room to get between the bulkhead and the engine)
* The engine uses a timing belt and this needs to be replaced sometimes otherwise failure means a broken engine

Since I became the owner of *Perspectief*, I have soundproofed the engine bay and this has helped a little but the engine is so big that the supports for the floor are sitting on top of the air intake (the highest pont of the engine. In the process to marinise this engine
