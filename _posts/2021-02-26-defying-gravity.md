Engines are very heavy objects being made from cast iron and steel. A typical diesel engine will weigh 140 kilos and a marine engine with a gearbox and heat exchanger attached could be up to 190kilos. So, how does one lift an engine from the boat's engine bay so that it can be removed from the boat.

## It has been done by Lots and Lots of people

Of course it has, so we can search on YouTube and find plenty of boaters and engineers who have shared their experiences. That's what I did, but no 2 situations are the same and mine is a steel cruiser without sails ans o I don't have a boom that can be used as a crane! Further, I have a narrow entrance to the wheelhouse with steps.

#### Building a gantry

So, in my situation, I am unable to get above the engine bay from outside the boat, so the siloution was to construct a gantry inside. I am fortunate to have some old timber from dismanteld childrens' bunk beds (yes, they have grwon up now). My solution was to build a pair of triangular structures to support a 100mm x 80mm length of timber (rescued from a  skip). I also supplemented this with a cross brace perpendicular and over to the upper helm access opening.
