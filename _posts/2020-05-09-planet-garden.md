So much to see in this small world between the fences. Plenty of time to get down and closeup to the world of plants and insects. Abundant greenness sprinkled with colour, pierced with sharpness. Home to our beautiful cat who is surprised that we are spending so much time on her planet.

Does Asima see in colour?

We don't want her to catch sight of Robin redbreast.

## Springing into colour

We have some fabulous wisteria hanging from an arch and this is getting a lot of attention from the wasps.

Each of these flowers holds just what the wasps need.

### Get in close

When you get in close you realise what miraculous shapes can be found at the macro level. The wasp gets in close too.

Buzz Buzz. Wisteria hysteria

### Let's see what the wasp sees

When you get in close you realise what miraculous shapes can be found at the macro level. The wasp gets in close too.

- It's a blur
- Now it's sharp
- Now it's in focus


We take the photo. As we look at the greenness of everything we realise that we are photographing the photosynthesis.

### Green interlude

And the lockdown day progressed with further in depth explorations of **Planet Garden**.
