New Betamarine engine arrived at the marina in a big cardboard box. Beuatifully packaged and mounted on a wooden palet. Two control panels where taken home for safe keeping and for checking against the new dashboards that I had made.

## The Engine Bay was prepared and waiting - did I get the measurements right?

You can't fit a brand new engine into a dirty engine bay can you?
