Diesel engines are heavy machines and cannot be lifted without some kind of pulley system. I used a chain hoist but I had to get above the engine bay somehow. I was fortunate enough to have a strng piece of 4 x 1.5in  length of pine that I was able to support on a pair of wooden triangles (bits of an old bunk bed). This constructed ganntry was enough to get the engine up onto the floor of the saloon.
