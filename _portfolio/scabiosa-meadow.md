Many varieties of wild flowers cover the ungrazed meadow, but noticeable are the lavender coloured  *Pincushion* flowers that are raised above all with their long stems.

With the camera lens at near ground level the soft meadow colours mix to make *glaucous* shades. From these tints in the image, geometric sweeps and bands of green and lilac are positioned with respect to the **divine proportion**.
