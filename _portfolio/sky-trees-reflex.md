Look up to the trees bare in the Winter sky. Look down in the cold waters we see the branches rippled in the surface, reflecting colours of the sky - mixed in with the watercolour. I balance and then unbalance the 2 sides of this rectangle; my arc joins and leaps across the shapes; the curve contains the branches that silhouette against the clouds in the sky cerulean.
