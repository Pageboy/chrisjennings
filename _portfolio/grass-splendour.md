In this **triptych** three backgrounds are used as the anchor for the circular forms and arcs that are hosting the chosen images.

*Depth of field* takes a double meaning when we push through the grasses and focus close to the waving blades; those that are beyond focus mix up the greens and yellows and create their own colour. 

Museum Grade varnished gicl√©e prints on 3 panels. Each one is 350mm x 565mm - overall 565mm x 1050mm. Panels are bolted together with stainless steel nuts and bolts.

Seen here in the studio.
