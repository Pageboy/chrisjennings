Peach coloured lobes and carmine red *stigma* of the hibiscus flowers reach out towards the Greek island sun. 

We focus on the forms of this cultivated **mallow** and pick out the colours to complete this rectangle with arcs and sweeps.

**UV varnished archival ink on fine art paper bonded to 2 panels 400mm x 565mm, bolted together - overall 565mm x 800mm**
