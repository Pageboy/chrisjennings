* Wind waving the water rushes
* Tangle of reeds
* Low sun over the river

I spend a lot of quality time on the river and I am inspired by the boundaries of the water and the bank; the trees, the reeds and the reflections when the water is still. This image uses the hexagon and the square as the basic underlying structure - then triangles of colour and photographs combined.
