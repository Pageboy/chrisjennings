Along the bank of the river the aster flowers are silhouetted against the rippling flow.

There is just a hint of the blueness of the sky reflected in the water although the trees from the far bank provide a contrasting darkness. The riverbank is now hosting these purple daisy-like flowers that are not native to these parts, never-the-less the colours help in the structure of this piece that is formed of arcs and divisions.
