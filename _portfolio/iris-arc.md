For a few brief days the garden *flags* show their brilliant purples and yellows. We are grateful for the insects that are attracted to them and act as pollinators for the next generation of flowers.

The low arc motif draws together the contrasting hues found in this variety, relating also to the shape of the rainbow. **Iris** was the Greek goddess of the rainbow.
