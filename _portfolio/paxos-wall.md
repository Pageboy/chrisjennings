Impressive dry stone walls stretch across this island, in the Ionian sea. Centuries of weathering, shaped by the salt-laden air, have given rise to a vibrant tapestry of lichens. The shades of sienna and yellow ochres, are used within the symmetrical curves of this composition to contrast with the rough stones.
