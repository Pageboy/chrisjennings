In the forest some trees are harvested, piled safely and revealing their aged rings. We count the rings to estimate theif age and notice that some rings are wide and others narrow. Nearby, a sapling oak is only just learning how to drop last yearâ€™s brown and brittle leaves curled by the recent frosts.
