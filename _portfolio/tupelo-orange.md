* Tupelo Orange
* Hazel Red
* Shaded Brown

Trees in the arboretum come from many parts of the world and we benefit from the collectors of saplings and seeds. After a hot summer, the hazel and the tupelo blend their vibrant orange and yellow colours contrasting against the shadows of the undergrowth.
