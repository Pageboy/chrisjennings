These pieces are based on the 16x9 proportion in landscape format. With this proportion the relationship between the length and height is not one half, so, in my construction of the geometry, I have added a single unit height rectangle at the bottom of each composition in an appropriate colour. This provides the ability to use vertical symmetry.

The works are available and can be purchased. They are printed on archival paper; the prints are signed and numbered and include a QR code that links back to the unique page here so that observers of the print can read the text that accompanies the image.

The colour of this block of is carefully chosen and effectively _underlines_ the construction.
