In this series the landscape shaped pieces are using the _golden ratio_. I won't go into all details about this here but essentially the ratio between the long and the short side is 1.61803. To be precise, this should be (1+âˆš5)/2.

The golden ratio rectangle is one of many _dynamic rectangles_ that can be rationally divided into visually interesting shapes.
