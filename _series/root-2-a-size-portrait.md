In this series the 'A' size is used but in a portrait format. The long side of the rectangle is formed by taking an arc with radius of the diagonal of the sqaure; where this meets the the extended line side of the square.

The ratio of the sides of this rectangle is root or 1.4142. This rectange forms the basis of the 'A' size, a European standard paper size with A0 being the largest.
