# A Perspectief on Cruising

**Perspectief** is a Dutch cruiser created from steel and first launched in 1987. The boat was made by Z-Yachts in Holland and is 8.5 metres long.
The company Z-Yachts (Zijderveld Yachts) no longer exists but boats of this design are known as Curtevenne. I bought the boat via Val Wyatt Marine in Wargrave, and–– according to the information passed to me––the boat has passed through 4 owners since first commissioned.
