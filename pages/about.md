Yes I am. Chris Jennings and I live in Oxford, UK.

I teach at Oxford Brookes University within the [Oxford International Centre for Publishing](https://publishing.brookes.ac.uk "see the Publishing web site - which I manage").

## My web sites

This site includes all of my eBook production and digital publishing help documents, presentations and screencasts. You can get loads of help if you are using InDesign to create eBooks.

[My boat *Perspectief*](https://www.chrisjennings.net/perspectief/)

I keep my boat on the Thames in Oxford, and am (as often as possible) making extended trips out on the river both upstream and downstream.
