Gathering images and geometry with added words. Taking shapes for a walk in the landscape and around my photograph collections.

These images are divided into series; mainly in respect of the proportions. The works are [available as prints in limited editions, and can be purchased](https://www.saatchiart.com/chrisjennings "see my work on Saatchi Art"). They are printed on archival paper; the prints are signed and numbered and include a QR code that links back to the unique page here so that observers of the print can read the text that accompanies the image.
